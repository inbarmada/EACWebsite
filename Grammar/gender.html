    <div id="title">Adjectives</div>
    <div id="info">In Spanish, every noun, including inanimate objects, has a "gender" of
      feminine or masculine. According to this, adjectives will have to be changed
      to reflect the noun's gender. Perhaps the most obvious example is that "the" for
      feminine nouns is "la," but is "el" for masculine nouns. In general, however,
      the rule is even simpler, with only the ending of the adjective needing to be
      changed, to "-a" for feminine and "-o" for masculine (although of course there are
      exceptions). Yet other adjectives have neither ending and do not need to be changed
      at all. <br><br>
      You also need to change adjectives for singular nouns as compared to plural nouns. However,
      this is extremely simple; you just need to add an "-s" to the end of the adjective
      (after you already conjugated it for gender).
      <br><br>
      Here are some examples of how adjectives would be changed for the feminine "la mesa" (the
      table) vs. the masculine "el escritorio" (the desk), and their plurals.
      <table class="verb-chart" align="center">
        <tr>
          <th>La Mesa</th>
          <th>Las Mesas</th>
          <th>Los Escritorios</th>
          <th>El Escritorio</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Limpia</td>
          <td>Limpias</td>
          <td>Limpios</td>
          <td>Limpio</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alta</td>
          <td>Altas</td>
          <td>Altos</td>
          <td>Alto</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Blanca</td>
          <td>Blancas</td>
          <td>Blancos</td>
          <td>Blanco</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Grande</td>
          <td>Grandes</td>
          <td>Grandes</td>
          <td>Grande</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Bonita</td>
          <td>Bonitas</td>
          <td>Bonitos</td>
          <td>Bonito</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <br><br>One example of an exception you might want to remember is "el agua" (the water),
      which actually has feminine adjective conjugations. <br><br>
