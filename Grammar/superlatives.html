    <div id="title">Superlatives</div>
    <div id="info">We can humans can have strong opinions sometimes. We not only know who is
      better, but we also know who is best. Declaring that something is "the most" out
      of a group is an example of using relative superlatives.<br><br>
      The structure of relative superlatives is somewhat similar to the of comparisons. However,
      you must put a definite article ("el" or "la") in front of the "m&aacute;s/menos," and
      follow the adjective with "de," rather than "que," as well as specify what group is being
      compared.
      <br><br>
      The examples will doubtlessly clarify this topic:
      <table class="verb-chart" align="center">
        <tr>
          <td>&Eacute;l es el chico <b>m&aacute;s gordo de</b> nuestra escuela.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ella es la chica <b>menos inteligente de</b> la clase.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Usain Bolt es el hombre <b>m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido del</b> mundo.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Yo soy el joven <b>menos interesante de</b> Tejas.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
