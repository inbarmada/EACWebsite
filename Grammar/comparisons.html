    <div id="info">We all compare stuff. It's human nature. And since we already do this
      in English, we might as well do it in Spanish as well. In fact, comparing
      things in Spanish in much easier than it seems. However, comparing inequalities
      and equalities do have some different grammar rules.<br><br>
      To say that something is more/less than something else, all you need to do is
      use the phrase: "m&aacute;s/menos" ______ "que." This is quite similar to the
      English structure of "more/less" ____ "than." In between these two words, you can compare
      just about anything, including nouns, adverbs, and adjectives.
      <br><br>
      Here are some examples:
      <table class="verb-chart" align="center">
        <tr>
          <td>&Eacute;l tiene mucho <b>m&aacute;s mascotas que</b> yo tengo.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Su tel&eacute;fono es <b>m&aacute;s caro que</b> mio.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pienso que &eacute;l corre solo un poco <b>menos r&aacute;pido que</b> Usain Bolt.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tengo <b>menos lap&iacute;zes que</b> mi amiga.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <br><br>
      To say that something is the same as something elseis a little harder. For
      adjectives, you use "tan" ______ "como." This is quite similar to the
      English structure of "as" ____ "as." For nouns, you would have to change the "tan"
      to "tanto/tanta/tantos/tantas" according to the noun. For verbs, you begin with the
      verb and then add "tanto como"; if the verbs are compared with an adverb, put it
      in between the "tan" and "como".
      <br><br>
      It's not as hard as it sounds! Here are some examples:
      <table class="verb-chart" align="center">
        <tr>
          <td>&Eacute;l tiene <b>tantos mascotas como</b> yo tengo.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Su tel&eacute;fono es <b>tan barato como</b> mio.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pienso que &eacute;l corre <b>tan r&aacute;pido como</b> Usain Bolt.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tengo <b>tantas rosas como</b> mi amiga.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Yo canto <b>tanto bien como</b> Beyonce.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
